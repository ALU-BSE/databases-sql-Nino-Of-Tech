# TechShop Database Management System :desktop_computer:

Welcome to the TechShop Database Management System! This project aims to design and implement a NoSQL database using MongoDB for an online marketplace called TechShop, where users can buy and sell various tech products.

## Key Tools :round_pushpin:
- **NoSQL:** 
NoSQL database is a type of database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in a non-tabular, flexible, and scalable manner. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL databases), NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, allowing for dynamic and evolving data structures. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data, distributed across multiple nodes, and are often used in big data and real-time web applications. 

- **MongoDB:** <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> is one of the most popular NoSQL databases. It is a document-oriented database, classified as a NoSQL database because it does not rely on a traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This means that fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time without affecting the application's functionality.


## Project Overview :pushpin:

TechShop is an online platform that facilitates the buying and selling of tech products such as laptops, smartphones, and accessories. As a database administrator for TechShop, my task is to design and implement a NoSQL database using MongoDB to store information about users, products, and transactions.

## Project Structure :wrench:
The project consists of the following components:

- Database Schema: Defines the structure of the NoSQL database, including collections for Users, Products, and Transactions.

- Implementation: MongoDB commands to create collections and insert sample data into the database.

- Queries: MongoDB queries for advanced operations such as finding products listed by a specific user, calculating the total amount spent by a user, and identifying the top 5 most popular products.


## Usage :white_check_mark:
To set up and test the TechShop database system, follow these steps:

#### Database Setup:

- Install MongoDB on your system if you haven't already.
- Use MongoDB commands provided in the implementation section to create collections for Users, Products, and Transactions.
- Sample Data Insertion: Insert sample data into the collections using MongoDB commands provided in the implementation section.
- Run Queries: Execute MongoDB queries provided in the queries section to perform advanced operations on the database.
- Testing: Verify the functionality of the database system by running queries and checking the results against the sample data.
