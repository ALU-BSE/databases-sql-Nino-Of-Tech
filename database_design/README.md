# TechShop Database Management System

Welcome to the TechShop Database Management System! This project aims to design and implement a NoSQL database using MongoDB for an online marketplace called TechShop, where users can buy and sell various tech products.

## Project Overview

TechShop is an online platform that facilitates the buying and selling of tech products such as laptops, smartphones, and accessories. As a database administrator for TechShop, my task is to design and implement a NoSQL database using MongoDB to store information about users, products, and transactions.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

- Database Schema: Defines the structure of the NoSQL database, including collections for Users, Products, and Transactions.

- Implementation: MongoDB commands to create collections and insert sample data into the database.

- Queries: MongoDB queries for advanced operations such as finding products listed by a specific user, calculating the total amount spent by a user, and identifying the top 5 most popular products.

- README: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.


## Usage
To set up and test the TechShop database system, follow these steps:

#### Database Setup:

- Install MongoDB on your system if you haven't already.
- Use MongoDB commands provided in the implementation section to create collections for Users, Products, and Transactions.
- Sample Data Insertion: Insert sample data into the collections using MongoDB commands provided in the implementation section.
- Run Queries: Execute MongoDB queries provided in the queries section to perform advanced operations on the database.
- Testing: Verify the functionality of the database system by running queries and checking the results against the sample data.
